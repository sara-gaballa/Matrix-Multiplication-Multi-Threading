## Requirements

* Implement the multi-threaded matrix multiplication using all three methods described above.
* Compare the three implementations according to the following:
    1. Number of threads created.
    2. Execution time taken.

Your programs should do the following:

* Your program is executed as: ./matMultp Mat1 Mat2 MatOut, where Mat1 and Mat2 are the names of the text files to read the first and second matrices, respectively, and MatOut is the prefix of the text files names to write the output matrices (each file represents one method). If the user does not enter this information, the default is a.txt and b.txt, for input matrixes A and B, and c for output matrices (of all three methods) C. The following example should clarify inputs/outputs files.

    Arguments

        Example: 
            ./matMultp a b c
        Input files: 
            a.txt 
            b.txt
        Output files: 
            c_per_matrix.txt
            c_per_row.txt
            c_per_element.txt

    No Arguments:

        Example: 
            ./matMultp
        Input files: 
            a.txt 
            b.txt
        Output files: 
            c_per_matrix.txt
            c_per_row.txt
            c_per_element.txt

    Custom Arguments:

        Example: 
            ./matMultp x y z
        Input files: 
            x.txt 
            y.txt
        Output files: 
            z_per_matrix.txt
            z_per_row.txt
            z_per_element.txt

* Read the number of rows and columns of the input matrices. They are written in the first line of the file as ”row=x col=y”. The following is an example of the format on an input file.

        row=3 col=5
        1 2 3 4 5
        6 7 8 9 10
        11 12 13 14 15

* Read the input matrices from their corresponding files. Each row is on a separate line, columns are separated by spaces.
* Use threads to calculate the matrix that results from multiplying the input two matrixes.
* Output the resulting matrices in three files (each file represents one method). The following is an example of the format of the three output files.

    c_per_matrix.txt

        Method: A thread per matrix
        row=2 col=2
        1 2
        3 4

    c_per_row.txt

        Method: A thread per row
        row=2 col=2
        1 2
        3 4

    c_per_element.txt

        Method: A thread per element
        row=2 col=2
        1 2
        3 4
